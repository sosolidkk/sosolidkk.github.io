I'm a Ruby Full-Stack Web Developer, who loves listening to music in my spare time and searching for random information (the more random the better). I design mostly monoliths, but I also enjoy doing some scripting and Web Scraping in my spare time. I'm not too fond of Angular, but let's be honest, who likes it? You can find my dumb codes [here](https://github.com/sosolidkk/) and read most of my findings here on this 'thing' I like to call a blog.
