> - Will Durant

I've never done this kind of post, but it's never late. Another year is behind us and I'll try to summarize most the stuff that I achieved and did throughout the year that I'm most proud of it or was just random.

## The bad stuff

Starting with the bad stuff because it feels more natural to me.

- I still failed to achieve the currently and log waited dream seniority as programmer. It feels like the more I yearn for it, the further away it becomes. Most of the time I keep thinking of what I'm currently missing so for the year of 2024, most of my goals will be directly related to achieve the title of a Senior developer, which I believe will be a turning point at my careers.
- I also failed to maintain a healthier lifestyle which kinda sucks, but it is becoming more of a pain since I'm getting regular back pain. I even switched my work chair and I'm policing myself regarding my posture when I sit. But let's see how it goes for this year.
- I did advance a lot in my first attempt to create and publish a [Ruby Gem](https://github.com/sosolidkk/steam_api) but I learned the hard way that we must always write the specs after class, because if not, it becomes a snow ball and man, it is a PAIN to do it after. But I'm commited to finish and publish it this year.

On top of all of that, I lacked inspiration to write anything related to programming or any other subject.

## The good stuff

Not so much to report here, to be honest. I did some freelance work and tried to develop and learn even more about the tooling and ecosystem in [Nuuvem](https://nuuvem.com).

I also got married, which is a HUGE accomplishment for me and even bigger for my wife. It was something that was in our talks for a long time, and we even postponed it due to personal issues.

## Eveything else

- I bought a Digispark Attiny85 USB. I saw a couple of videos about the usage of it and found quite interesting the way the scripts were injected. Most of the examples I used were public on GitHub repositories. The unique downside of it was that I could not make it work under Linux because of the poorly updated drivers. It was a pain. I needed to get up a VM with Windows and do the same configuration for it to work. After uploading the first script, a simple password grabber, it was pretty good to see it work.
- I had a fun time with my peers in our annual compny meeting at december.
- I planned to switch from my iPhone to an Android device simply because I can't stand Apple anymore. This year was a switch for me in terms of device usage. I deleted most of the apps I used daily, and in all the free time that I got, I invested in my Kindle which turned out to be awesome.
- As I said in the previous topic, I bought a Kindle. It did take some time to decide if I needed one, but guess what, I did need one. My goal of reading X books a year would be SO MUCH EASIER if I already had a Kindle. Now any opportunity I have, be it lunch, waking up, brushing my teeth, or waiting for the doctor to call on my medical appointment I'm reading.
- The best show for me this year was HBO's Scavenger Reign. I didn't watch that many shows, but this one was memorable enough.
- Baldur's Gate 3 also won GOTY, which was obvious. It's the best game Larian Studios ever released and one of the best CRPGs since Divinity Original Sin 2 and Pillars of Eternity.

## Lessons Learned

Stealing the quote from Bozhidar Bastov blog:
> We are what we repeatedly do… Not exactly something new I learned in 2023, but definitely something I was often reminded about.

One thing I noticed is that I need to be more focused on the stuff that I need to get done, instead of looking and droving of my attention somewhere else.

## Goals for 2024

You can read them in my [2024 post]({% post_url 2024-01-01-2024 %}).

## Epilogue

> Not great, not terrible.

It could've been better, but it was the best possible outcome given the current scenario, plans, and more.

I hope anyone who reads this has a great 2024, even more than 2023.
