**Starting from 2024...**

I'm still working from home every day since March of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the beginning, I didn't enjoy the switch from office to remote work because I struggled to manage my time effectively and separate work, home duties, and personal time. ~~However, I have fully embraced the remote work lifestyle and can't see myself stepping away from it.~~ I still love remote work, but I occasionally miss the office and the direct human interaction—going out for a beer or grabbing a bite with colleagues.

I’m still a part of the [Nuuvem](https://www.nuuvem.com/) development team and have been promoted to Senior Software Developer. I’m enjoying the work and pace of the company, facing new challenges, and experiencing significant growth in my skills as a developer.

On the reading front, I finally managed to acquire a Kindle and I've been reading a lot! I recently finished [Damn Reincarnation](https://damn-reincarnation.fandom.com/wiki/Damn_Reincarnation_Wiki) and [Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei](https://mahouka-koukou-no-rettousei.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) novels, and I'm currently reading **Jantar Secreto** by Raphael Montes.

I’m also getting back on track with retro gaming. Currently, I'm playing [Pokémon Radical Red](https://retroachievements.org/user/jpechaves) on a [Abernic RG35XXSP](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xxsp) with [MuOS](https://muos.dev/) and ramping up on a couple of Nintendo Switch games, with [Octopath Traveler 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler) being my game of choice at the moment. I decided to give up my [Steam library](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sosolidkk1/) and focus on my Nintendo Switch and retro games. I figured out that every time I turn on the PC to play, I keep thinking of work. The Nintendo Switch is helping to put my mind at ease and not think of work every time I boot it.

Recently, I decided to stop paying for Spotify and bought an MP3 player. I’m going back to downloading and buying songs since Spotify has started removing a few of my favorites.
