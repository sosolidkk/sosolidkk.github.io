**Starting from January 2024...**

I'm still working from home every day since March of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the beginning, I didn't enjoy the switch from office to work from home because I couldn't manage my time correctly and differentiate what is work, home duties, and spare time for myself. But now I've fully embraced the remote work system and can't see myself stepping away from it.

I joined the [Nuuvem](https://www.nuuvem.com/) development team at the end of May and have been enjoying a lot the work and pace of the company. Got a lot of challenges and I'm already feeling a great improvement in my skills as a developer.

I'm also trying to get some old habits on track, like drawing and ~~reading~~ (UPDATE: I FINALLY MANAGED TO ACQUIRE A KINDLE AND I'VE BEEN READING A LOT). I used to post my drawings at my [Artstation profile](https://artstation.com/sosolidkk), but I'm not doing any digital drawings anymore, only paper.

I decided to give up my [Steam library](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sosolidkk1/) and focus on my Nintendo Switch games. I figured out that every time I turn on the PC to play, I keep thinking of work. The Nintendo Switch is helping to put my mind at ease and not think of work every time I boot it.

Lastly, I GOT MARRIED on November 11, 2023, the same day and month I got to know my wife. ~~It was also the same day that Skyrim launched (11/11/11).~~
