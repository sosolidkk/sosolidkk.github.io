I traveled, I switched jobs, I met new people, I had fun in my older and newer company confraternization party and I managed to complete 3 of my 5 goals set for the whole year of 2022. I can’t say I’m 100% happy with 2022 but it’s undeniable that it was a great year without a hunch of a doubt. For 2023, I just want to complete some of the goals that I missed for 2022 and set a couple of new ones. Goals for 2023 - Finished Read five ten or more books I have a lot of books in my shelf just waiting to be read since 2020. So I’m just trying to get back with an old habit that I already had. This goal I missed HARD in 2022. I read three and a half books throughout the whole year, and while I&#39;m not proud of it, I&#39;m just happy that I did read something. Most of the time that I spent reading are just those dumb Chinese/Korean light novels and tech articles, so refreshing my mind with some dense and long books was fun. So I&#39;m just going to double the goal and see if I can make at least one a month and thats it. Maintain a healthy diet and life style No need to explain. To be honest, I didn&#39;t even try. I played a lot of volleyball (at least twice a week) and more often than not did a 5km walk, but it isn&#39;t enough, to be honest. This is a must for 2023. Try to gain at least one salary raise this year No need to explain too. And no, I’m not looking right now for a new Job. I’m happy with the one i got right now and I still have a lot to learn from the people that I work every single day. It&#39;s funny because in January I said I wasn&#39;t looking for a job but till May, a lot had happened that made me start looking for Jobs as quickly as possible, and I don&#39;t regret the decision I made. I&#39;m actually quite happy and fulfilled in my current job at Nuuvem. So for this year I just want to make more impactful changes and improve even more my workplace. Travel at least Twice My girlfriend loves to travel, and while I’m not into it as much as she, she gets on my nerves a lot by asking me when and where we’ll be traveling this year. Get more experience to reach the level of a Senior developer No need to explain." />
