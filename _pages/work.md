#### [RD Station](https://www.rdstation.com/) - Backend Software Developer (Contract)
`JUNE 2023 - JANUARY 2024, REMOTE`

I helped to develop a new multi-product webhook tool using the most up-to-date code practices and tools of the Ruby on Rails ecosystem. This tool delivered more than a million webhooks per day and through different client applications, offering the best, with zero friction, multi-product interface possible so it can integrate into different internal applications that the company had. The application just needed to set up an event pipeline and send it to the webhook service, and it would handle the rest.

I also helped to maintain and improve the company's existing APIs.
