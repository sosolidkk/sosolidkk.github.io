I'm a Ruby/Python Backend Developer, who loves listening to music in his spare time and searching for random things. I design monoliths and scrap some websites. Sometimes do some stuff on Frontend, like to know a little of everything. You can find some of my code [here](https://github.com/sosolidkk/) and share some of my thoughts and experiences here on this blog.

This blog is based on Jeykll and is hosted on GitHub. For issues, improvement, and suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull requests on this [project](https://github.com/sosolidkk/sosolidkk.github.io).
