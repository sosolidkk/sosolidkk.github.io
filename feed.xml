<p><strong>Following Last Year’s Tradition: My 2024 Year Recap</strong></p>

<p>As always, this post is my chance to take a step back, reflect on the past year, and share some of the highlights—both the good and the not-so-great. It’s a moment to celebrate achievements, recount unique experiences, and, of course, confront the things that didn’t go as planned.</p>

<p>This post might be a little late, but hey—better late than never!</p>

<h2 id="the-bad-stuff">The bad stuff</h2>

<p>In the spirit of honesty, I like to start with the negatives, which often come to mind first.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Health Goals Missed (Again):</strong>
  I’m still struggling to maintain a healthier lifestyle. To be fair, there was some progress: I began physiotherapy, and in December, I managed a solid month of going to the gym before…well, falling off the wagon again. My goal for 2025? Stick with it for at least six straight months and make it a sustainable habit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">steam_api</code> Gem Release:</strong>
  This was one of my goals, but life threw me a curveball. Between work demands and personal responsibilities, I couldn’t find the time or focus to wrap up the project. It’s disappointing, but I’ve learned that some things take a backseat when life gets hectic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gaming Slump:</strong>
  This one hurts the most. I’ve always cherished gaming, but in 2024, I barely touched my favorite hobby. If I played and finished ten games, that would be generous. The only title I really invested time in was <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>, and even then, I only made it to Chapter Four out of six.
  Why the slump? I think it boils down to decision paralysis. My Steam library is massive, and having so many options ends up being more stressful than fun. I’d spend way too much time scrolling, trying to decide what to play, instead of actually playing. Big, immersive games that require hours at a desk just don’t seem to click with me anymore.</p>

    <p>Every time I turn on my laptop, I feel the urge to program, not play games. It’s clear that my environment—using my computer primarily as a work tool in an office setting—has had a significant impact on my overall PC gaming experience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-good-stuff">The good stuff</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MP3 Player</strong>
  This was a goal I’d had for a while, and I finally went for it. Thanks to one of those endless digital minimalism or “retro gadgets” videos that kept popping up on my YouTube feed, I grabbed a cheap MP3 player from AliExpress. Since then, I’ve been downloading most of the music I’ve listened to over the past six months, and honestly, it’s been such a refreshing experience.</p>

    <p>The idea of canceling my Spotify subscription even crossed my mind. It’s funny—I tend to listen to the same artists and songs on repeat anyway, so why not make it offline and intentional? This small purchase brought me unexpected joy, and I’m excited to keep building my little personal library of music.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anbernic RG35XX-SP: A BEAST!</strong>
  Another YouTube-inspired purchase! After bingeing retro gaming videos, I couldn’t resist the Anbernic RG35XX-SP—a clamshell console that brings back serious Game Boy Advance SP vibes. This little beast handles everything from Gameboy to PSP and PS1 games, and the first thing I did after unboxing was install the MUOS custom firmware (<a href="https://muos.dev">muos.dev</a>).</p>

    <p>It’s been a blast. While I’m not as motivated to play games on my PC, I’ve been loving quick 30-minute sessions of Pokémon Red and Pokémon Silver. It’s been like revisiting childhood memories but with a modern twist. If you’re into retro gaming, I’d highly recommend picking one up—it’s as awesome as advertised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Promoted to Senior Developer and Tech Lead</strong>
  This was a huge milestone for me. Mid-year, I was promoted to Senior Developer at my company—a significant step forward in my career. Then, towards the end of the year, I was offered a provisional Tech Lead position for a small team (just one person so far, but hey, we all start somewhere!).</p>

    <p>Leadership wasn’t something I initially aimed for. I’ve always been more drawn to the technical side—coding, problem-solving, and building cool things. But after some meaningful discussions with my previous team leader throughout 2024, I realized this role is an opportunity to bring about the changes I’ve always wanted to see in the company. By sharing my ideas and guiding the team, I’m hoping to leave a positive mark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quality Time with Family</strong>
  One of the best decisions we made this year was prioritizing family time, thanks to a suggestion from my wife. Whenever we had the chance, we visited our parents or spent time with close relatives. Life is short, and being around the people we love is priceless.</p>

    <p>From relaxing weekends at my in-laws’ countryside home to game nights with friends and dinners with my parents, these moments stood out as some of the most meaningful. We even spent Christmas and New Year’s Eve with family—something we don’t usually do, but it was absolutely worth it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Work Fun:</strong>
  December brought our annual company meeting, and I had an absolute blast catching up with colleagues. It’s always great to connect outside of the day-to-day grind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Books, Books, and More Books:</strong>
  My Kindle got a serious workout in 2024! I managed to read about 50 books, mostly fiction (my comfort zone), though I also tackled a few programming books along the way. One thing I wish we had more of in Brazil is affordable, smaller e-readers. While I love my Kindle Paperwhite, it’s a bit bulky for one-handed reading. I might hunt down an older, smaller model to make my reading sessions even more enjoyable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Naked and Afraid:</strong>
  One standout show I spent time with this year was Naked and Afraid. Watching people survive extreme situations (and doing it all <strong>NAKED</strong>!) was oddly fascinating. Props to everyone who’s brave enough to go through that—just imagining it is wild!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hard work truly pays off</strong>. Put your best effort into everything you do, and trust that people will notice your dedication. The rewards may not come immediately, but they’ll arrive when you least expect them—just like my promotions did. Every ounce of effort you put in will eventually pay dividends. So, always give it your all and stay consistent.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep good friends close, and keep family even closer</strong>. Life is short, so don’t take the people you love for granted. Embrace them, tell them you love them, and prioritize spending quality time together. Those moments are priceless and will stay with you forever.</li>

<p>The OS by default also doesn’t enable it, which was the cause for all my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agents</code> goes missing every time I tried to do any connection and even asking for password again.</p>

<p>Lookint at the Gitlab MR, it seems like we’re now supposed to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcr-ssh-agent</code>. Here’s the instructions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Run</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemctl enable --user gcr-ssh-agent.socket</code> to enable the socket.</li>
  <li><strong>Set</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment value to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gcr/ssh</code>. I just put this in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code>:
    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gcr/ssh</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reboot</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>After those two changes, your SSH keys should start working just like before.</p>

<hr />

<p>Other workaround I was doing before finding those threads were adding this to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="nt">-z</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$SSH_AUTH_SOCK</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then

  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github &amp;&gt; /dev/null
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_gitlab &amp;&gt; /dev/null
<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem with this approach is that it will init a new ssh-agent for every newly created console session since the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zshrc</code> will be loaded every time. But since it was a workaround, I didn’t care. It was more stressful not to have it working at all.</p>

<p>I’ve never done this kind of post, but it’s never late. Another year is behind us and I’ll try to summarize most the stuff that I achieved and did throughout the year that I’m most proud of it or was just random.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad-stuff">The bad stuff</h2>

<p>Starting with the bad stuff because it feels more natural to me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I still failed to achieve the currently and log waited dream seniority as programmer. It feels like the more I yearn for it, the further away it becomes. Most of the time I keep thinking of what I’m currently missing so for the year of 2024, most of my goals will be directly related to achieve the title of a Senior developer, which I believe will be a turning point at my careers.</li>
  <li>I also failed to maintain a healthier lifestyle which kinda sucks, but it is becoming more of a pain since I’m getting regular back pain. I even switched my work chair and I’m policing myself regarding my posture when I sit. But let’s see how it goes for this year.</li>
  <li>I did advance a lot in my first attempt to create and publish a <a href="https://github.com/sosolidkk/steam_api">Ruby Gem</a> but I learned the hard way that we must always write the specs after class, because if not, it becomes a snow ball and man, it is a PAIN to do it after.

<p>Not so much to report here, to be honest. I did some freelance work and tried to develop and learn even more about the tooling and ecosystem in <a href="https://nuuvem.com">Nuuvem</a>.</p>

  <li>I bought a Digispark Attiny85 USB. I saw a couple of videos about the usage of it and found quite interesting the way the scripts were injected.

  <li>I had a fun time with my peers in our annual compny meeting at december.</li>
  <li>I planned to switch from my iPhone to an Android device simply because I can’t stand Apple anymore. This year was a switch for me in terms of device usage. I deleted most of the apps I used daily, and in all the free time that I got, I invested in my Kindle which turned out to be awesome.</li>
  <li>As I said in the previous topic, I bought a Kindle. It did take some time to decide if I needed one, but guess what, I did need one. My goal of reading X books a year would be SO MUCH EASIER if I already had a Kindle. Now any opportunity I have, be it lunch, waking up, brushing my teeth, or waiting for the doctor to call on my medical appointment I’m reading.</li>
  <li>The best show for me this year was HBO’s Scavenger Reign. I didn’t watch that many shows, but this one was memorable enough.</li>
  <li>Baldur’s Gate 3 also won GOTY, which was obvious. It’s the best game Larian Studios ever released and one of the best CRPGs since Divinity Original Sin 2 and Pillars of Eternity.</li>

Will Durant I’ve never done this kind of post, but it’s never late. Another year is behind us and I’ll try to summarize most the stuff that I achieved and did throughout the year that I’m most proud of it or was just random. The bad stuff Starting with the bad stuff because it feels more natural to me. I still failed to achieve the currently and log waited dream seniority as programmer. It feels like the more I yearn for it, the further away it becomes. Most of the time I keep thinking of what I’m currently missing so for the year of 2024, most of my goals will be directly related to achieve the title of a Senior developer, which I believe will be a turning point at my careers. I also failed to maintain a healthier lifestyle which kinda sucks, but it is becoming more of a pain since I’m getting regular back pain. I even switched my work chair and I’m policing myself regarding my posture when I sit. But let’s see how it goes for this year. I did advance a lot in my first attempt to create and publish a Ruby Gem but I learned the hard way that we must always write the specs after class, because if not, it becomes a snow ball and man, it is a PAIN to do it after. But I’m commited to finish and publish it this year. On top of all of that, I lacked inspiration to write anything related to programming or any other subject. The good stuff Not so much to report here, to be honest. I did some freelance work and tried to develop and learn even more about the tooling and ecosystem in Nuuvem.

My biggest problem with re-installing my Linux distro is the time that takes to configure everything all over again.

<hr />
<h4 id="zsh"><strong>Zsh</strong></h4>
<p>Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ksh</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tcsh</code> were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added.</p>

My biggest problem with re-installing my Linux distro is the time that takes to configure everything all over again. So, instead of googling everything, I’ve chosen to register most of the programs that I need to install after a fresh wipe of the OS and how I deal with the configuration of all of them and some of my dotfiles for an easier copy and paste for future wipes. Programs list zsh oh-my-zsh asdf vscode 1password postgres terminal Just to make sure we have everything we’ll need before hand, run this: $ sudo pacman-mirrors --fasttrack &amp;&amp; sudo pacman -Syyu $ sudo pacman -S base base-devel git yay lm_sensors $ yay -S google-chrome visual-studio-code-bin After you system is updated, let’s install the remaining tools. Zsh Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added. $ sudo pacman -S zsh $ chsh -s $(which zsh) $ echo $SHELL Oh my zsh I install this because it’s easier to setup some themes on my shell. sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)" SpaceShip Spaceship is a minimalistic, powerful and extremely customizable zsh prompt. It combines everything you may need for convenient work, without unnecessary complications, like a real spaceship. git clone https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt" --depth=1 ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme" # Set ZSH_THEME="spaceship" in your .zshrc. Zinit Zinit is a flexible and fast Zshell plugin manager that will allow you to install everything from GitHub and other sites. bash -c "$(curl --fail --show-error --silent --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit/HEAD/scripts/install.sh)" # Add the next three lines after this part: '### End of ZInit's installer chunk' zinit light zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions zinit light zsh-users/zsh-completions Github SSH $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # Then just 'cat' the id_ed25519.pub and add it in the github ssh settings VSCode Visual Studio Code is pretty straight forward. You just need to click on the Login to Sync config option and it’s pretty much all done after you logged in successfully.

I like some of the videos he posts, especially the series where he roasts several job openings or videos on the theme of <strong>One day in the life of a software developer</strong> that don’t quite fit the reality of many, or is it just pure marketing for the company that employee works for. I don’t take the content brought so seriously because anyway, it’s always important to filter what you should consume or not. When starting this video, I imagined it would be the same as always, people advising on what they would do if they could go back in time, what they did to make up for a lost time, and the glimpse that came when they realized they were wasting their lives at that moment. As I said, I avoid watching this type of video because it gives me the idea that if they managed to do X and Y, it should also be possible for me to do the same X and Y and I end up not considering the small events that happened during the entire process. In this specific video that I mentioned above, I blocked as much of this type of message as possible and filtered it into some points of interest that I identified, such as:</p>

<p>The author of the video quotes a phrase that stuck in my head, and like him, I’m also a person who likes animals a lot. The phrase is: <strong>be the person your dog thinks you are</strong>. Usually, the dog is just a companion that we can live without, however much it is included in our daily lives and there is that emotional attachment. But for the dog, we are his world. He has nothing left, or at least he can’t excoriate anything but us. It’s as if we were the ideal entity for him, who provides water and food, takes him for walks, caresses, etc.</p>

<p>Another point was the question of games. Don’t get me wrong, I’m as addicted, or once was, as any other teenager who grew up during WOW, RuneScape, CoD, Battlefield, and Halo between 2005 and 2013. I’ve played so many games I can’t even remember half of it anymore, I’ve lost hours and hours in RPGs and Action Rogue Likes. Playing games has always been a way of escape from difficult times and when I wanted to let go of anything that had been occupying my mind. But there comes a stage in life when games no longer have the same flavor, you no longer have time or desire to spend 8 hours a day on a game that will probably undergo a rework in a few months with a new patch or a new season pass. You feel bad about playing because you know you could be doing something more productive like reading a book, going out, or developing a new hobby.</p>

<p>After those two sentences, that’s when I realized that I was in the same situation Joshua found himself in. 24 years old, playing unwillingly to keep the habit alive knowing he could do a lot more. That’s when I realized that if I didn’t change, I would probably regret it when I was 29 and close to turning 30, I would have a similar thought of how my 20s could be very different if I had gone in different directions. That said, to start the year well, I will try to do a reflection after the turnaround about the past year, describe my goals and see if I managed to reach them in the following year, talk a little about what touched me and marked me throughout the year.</p>

I like some of the videos he posts, especially the series where he roasts several job openings or videos on the theme of One day in the life of a software developer that don’t quite fit the reality of many, or is it just pure marketing for the company that employee works for. I don’t take the content brought so seriously because anyway, it’s always important to filter what you should consume or not. When starting this video, I imagined it would be the same as always, people advising on what they would do if they could go back in time, what they did to make up for a lost time, and the glimpse that came when they realized they were wasting their lives at that moment. As I said, I avoid watching this type of video because it gives me the idea that if they managed to do X and Y, it should also be possible for me to do the same X and Y and I end up not considering the small events that happened during the entire process. In this specific video that I mentioned above, I blocked as much of this type of message as possible and filtered it into some points of interest that I identified, such as: The author of the video quotes a phrase that stuck in my head, and like him, I’m also a person who likes animals a lot. The phrase is: be the person your dog thinks you are. Usually, the dog is just a companion that we can live without, however much it is included in our daily lives and there is that emotional attachment. But for the dog, we are his world. He has nothing left, or at least he can’t excoriate anything but us. It’s as if we were the ideal entity for him, who provides water and food, takes him for walks, caresses, etc. Another point was the question of games. Don’t get me wrong, I’m as addicted, or once was, as any other teenager who grew up during WOW, RuneScape, CoD, Battlefield, and Halo between 2005 and 2013. I’ve played so many games I can’t even remember half of it anymore, I’ve lost hours and hours in RPGs and Action Rogue Likes. Playing games has always been a way of escape from difficult times and when I wanted to let go of anything that had been occupying my mind. But there comes a stage in life when games no longer have the same flavor, you no longer have time or desire to spend 8 hours a day on a game that will probably undergo a rework in a few months with a new patch or a new season pass. You feel bad about playing because you know you could be doing something more productive like reading a book, going out, or developing a new hobby.
