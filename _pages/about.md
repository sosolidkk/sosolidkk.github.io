I’m a Ruby Full-Stack Software Developer currently thriving as a senior developer at [Nuuvem](https://www.nuuvem.com/-/about), where I’ve embraced the challenges of full-stack product development using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, AWS, Docker, and both MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I take pride in optimizing performance, delivering robust features and teaching my peers random stuff.

While I primarily design monolithic applications, I also engage in scripting and web scraping projects. I’m not particularly fond of Angular, but let’s be honest—who is? You can explore some of my code [here](https://github.com/sosolidkk/) and read my musings and discoveries on this blog, which I affectionately refer to as my little corner of the internet.
