<meta name="description" content="It seems that starting from version 1:46.0-1, the gnome-keyring changed it’s behavior and now it disables building the ssh-agent support by default.

Lookint at the Gitlab MR, it seems like we’re now supposed to use gcr-ssh-agent. Here’s the instructions: Run: systemctl enable --user gcr-ssh-agent.socket to enable the socket. Set: $SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment value to $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gcr/ssh. I just put this in my .zshrc: export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gcr/ssh Reboot After those two changes, your SSH keys should start working just like before. Other workaround I was doing before finding those threads were adding this to my .zshrc: if [ -z &quot;$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; ]; then eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot; &gt; /dev/null ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github &amp;&gt; /dev/null ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_gitlab &amp;&gt; /dev/null fi The problem with this approach is that it will init a new ssh-agent for every newly created console session since the .zshrc will be loaded every time.
