**Starting from August 2022...**

I've been primarily working from home every day since March of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the beginning, I didn't enjoy the switch from office to work from home because I couldn't manage my time correctly and differentiate what is work, home duties, and spare time for myself. But now I've fully embraced the remote work system and can't see myself stepping away from it.

I joined the [Nuuvem](https://www.nuuvem.com/) development team at the end of May and have been enjoying a lot the work and pace of the company. Got a lot of challenges and I'm already feeling a great improvement in my skills as a developer.
> In case you want to join our team, checkout the [careers](https://careers.nuuvem.com/) page. We're almost always hiring!

I'm also trying to get some old habits on track, like drawing and reading. I used to post my drawing at my [Artstation profile](https://artstation.com/sosolidkk), but I'm not doing any digital drawings anymore. Only on paper.

Still going through my [Steam library](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sosolidkk1/) trying to decide what to play and not playing anything at the end.
