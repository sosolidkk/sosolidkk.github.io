**Starting from 2025...**

I'm still working from home every day since March 2020, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. At first, I didn’t enjoy the switch from office to remote work—I struggled to manage my time and separate work, home duties, and personal time. ~~However, I have fully embraced the remote work lifestyle and can't see myself stepping away from it.~~ I still love remote work, but I do occasionally miss the office and the direct human interaction—like going out for a beer or grabbing a bite with colleagues.


I’m still part of the [Nuuvem](https://www.nuuvem.com/) development team and have been promoted to Tech Lead. I’m really enjoying the work and the pace of the company, tackling new challenges, and growing a lot as a developer.

That said, being a Tech Lead comes with a whole new set of challenges, which, honestly, feel way harder than just coding.

On the reading front, I’m still reading daily on my Kindle. I’m not too happy about [Amazon’s recent policy changes](https://galaxy.ai/youtube-summarizer/amazons-kindle-policy-change-what-you-need-to-know-before-february-26-iK1ZZInYRHY) on Ebook downloads, but here in Brazil, it’s tough to find an E-reader that matches the Kindle without having to import one. Here’s my current reading list as of this update:
- **Nano Machine**
- **A Short Stay in Hell** by *Steven L. Peck*
- **The Manager's Path** by *Camille Fournier*
- **Agile Web Development with Rails 8** by *Sam Ruby* with *Dave Thomas*
- **The Three-Body Problem** by *Liu Cixin*


I’ve gone back to downloading and buying songs since Spotify started removing some of my favorites. I’ve also stopped gaming for now—I’m feeling pretty burned out from it.


My new hobby is drawing. I’m taking a few courses and seeing where it goes.
