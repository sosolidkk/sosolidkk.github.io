A **prime number** is a natural number bigger than 1 and that is not a product of two other natural numbers smaller than himself. In other words, it's a number that is divisible only by 1 and himself. As an example of that, we have 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and much more prime numbers. When a number is not **prime** we can say it is composed.

A **compose number** is an positive integer that can be found by multiplying two other numbers that aren't 1 and himself (basically the inverse of the prime number definition). When comparing those two, there's a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic) that states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of **two or more prime numbers**. For example, we have **1200**, that can be represented as `2^4 * 3 * 5^2`.
