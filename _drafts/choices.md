So, this week I was watching a video of [Joshua Fluke](https://www.youtube.com/user/Tychos1). I really enjoy some of the roast videos that he makes, but one in special caught my attention. It's called [I wasted my 20s.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VCxkMvKUnA). Starting the video I was hoping that it was one more of those that people makes to talk about how their life was, what they did to improve it and how they are now. Usually I don't pay a lot of attention to those videos because I'm a little skeptical about them and all the things that people talk about (problems, money, insurance, marriage, etc).
