I wanted to do a blog project for a long time. <!--more--> I've always had some difficulty sharing some of my thoughts and experiences related to life, work, hobbies, and such.

So, as a goal for 2022, I'll try to write at least once a week into this blog and try to make this out of a new hobby and incorporate it into my daily routine as a Developer.

Disclaimer: don't take everything here too seriously. They're my experiences and personal thoughts. Much of what I'll be saying don't have any scientific background. Anyway, have fun and enjoy your stay!
